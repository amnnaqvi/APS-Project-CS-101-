# APS-Project
This was our very first project, completed at the end of our first semester as Computer Science undergraduates. The program are three basic games, a Hangmam, a Jumble, and Tic-Tac-Toe. The first two games have levels easy, medium, and hard, and may be played by one person from the existing library or two people, i.e, one of them enters the word while the other guesses it. Tic-Tac-Toe also has a one and two-played feature; in one player the player plays against the computer. In one player, the computer makes moves based on an existing library of moves and their corresponding frequencies, it updates this library when it learns moves from the two player game between two individuals.
